The Face Finder

I have created a project on Visual Studio which detects a human image and draws a box around that face. The project detects human faces using Python and OpenCV, utilizing the Haar Cascade classifier for frontal face detection. It employs `cv2.rectangle` to draw bounding boxes with x, y coordinates as well as width and height on detected faces. Additionally, `cv2.waitKey(25) == 32` is implemented to pause for 25 milliseconds and check if the spacebar (ASCII 32) is pressed, allowing for interactive controls. Plus, I ran it through a bunch of human images to fine-tune the detection and to avoid errors.
